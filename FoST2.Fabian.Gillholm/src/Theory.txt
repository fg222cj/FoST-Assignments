====================================================

1.
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) comes in many different implementations. Different implementations may be created for
use in different environments or be used for different purposes. Programs written in Java are compiled into Java
Bytecode, which is executed by the JVM.

2.
Classpath is a parameter that can be set to tell java where to look for the user created java-files. If no classpath is
set, Java defaults to the current working directory.

3.
Java can be written in any text editor. A separate compiler can be used to compile a package or class to an executable.

4.
A jar-file is a collection of of Java classes and other resources packed into a single file. This is useful as a means
of distributing applications and libraries.

5.
When running an application java looks for the a method matching "public static void main(String[])". If it's an applet,
it looks for init() instead.

6.
A package is the java equivalent of a namespace. It's a way to bundle classes that are closely related to each other.

7.
An interface is a blueprint (actually more like a contract) that other classes may need to implement. The reason it
should not be changed is that classes that rely on it will also need to be changed accordingly, and we are not always
aware of all the classes that implement a specific interface.

8.
Public, private, protected and package private. Package private is the default, and means that the method, class or
field is accessible to all other classes in the same package.

9.
An exception is a foreseeable problem within the code that can (and should) be caught and handled. An error is an
anomaly that shouldn't reasonably be expected to occur (if it is, then the code should be improved so that it doesn't)
and that shouldn't be caught. It is extreme enough that the preferred way of dealing with it is to allow the application
to crash.

10.
OutOfMemoryError occurs when the application tries to exceed its allotted amount of memory. NoClassDefFoundError occurs
when no class definition for a class can be found. A class definition is created when a class is first loaded and if
the loading fails for whatever reason and the program keeps running, then the next time the same class is needed java
will throw a NoClassDefFoundError error since the definition was never created. NullPointerException occurs when we try
to do something with or to an object with no assigned value (except for assigning it a value).

11.
I don't. But if I did I would probably try to be aware of what exceptions might be thrown and catch them. The catch code
should preferably do something in response to the exception so that the application can keep running as intended,
possibly with additional action required from the user. There should also be a catch-all at the top of the program to
capture unforeseen exceptions.

12.
Because the code might have bugs. Because it might not work according to the requirements. Because it might not be user
friendly. Because even if none of those cases apply, testing is the only way to make sure of that and be confident that
the application is of high quality.

13.
Javadoc is a tool to create external documentation from internal code comments. For it to work the comments must follow
a specific syntax. A comment should be placed before a class, method or field declaration and can contain special tags.
Example:
/**
 * This is a comment.
